#Gibber User Manual

This book is a manual for [Gibber, a creative coding environment for the browser](http://gibber.mat.ucsb.edu). It tries to give insight into the thinking behind Gibber's design and on the practices for using it. I intend for it to be a living document and gradually grow over time... if you have any suggestions for it please get in touch! 

The book is written to be displayed on [gitbook.io](https://www.gitbook.io/book/bigbadotis/gibber-user-manual), but you can easily leaf through the various chapters and read them in GitHub if you'd like.

Thanks for reading and trying out Gibber! - Charlie
